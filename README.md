## A SAT Solver with a simple DPLL Algorithm

There are two version of the solver.

* [solver](solver) is a version that fully uses the provided classes and interfaces. It is slower but more reliable.

* [solver_fast](solver_fast) is a version that uses part of the provided classes and interfaces. It is faster but not as reliable. Strongly discourage to use this version.

There are some sample cnf files to test the solver which can be found in [sampleCNF](sampleCNF).
